_# Restaurant Revenue Prediction

## Overview

The Restaurant Revenue Prediction project aims to revolutionize the process of selecting new restaurant locations by leveraging the power of machine learning.
With the challenge of determining when and where to open new restaurants, this project addresses the subjectivity of decision-making and the financial risks associated with site selection.

By analyzing demographic, real estate, and commercial data, we have developed a mathematical model that predicts the annual sales of potential restaurant sites. 
This predictive model not only helps in making informed decisions but also enables efficient allocation of resources, allowing for increased investments in areas like sustainability,
innovation, and employee training.

## Abstract

The food and restaurant industry, evergreen and ever-evolving, presents exciting growth opportunities. Consumers have a wide range of choices, from cuisine types to food quality, 
and they continually seek something new and better. Launching a restaurant involves significant capital, effort, and time. Therefore, it's crucial to consider numerous factors when 
choosing a location. This project harnesses the power of data and machine learning to enhance investment effectiveness and competitiveness in this dynamic industry.

## Problem Statement

The current approach to launching new restaurants relies heavily on the subjective judgment of development teams, making it challenging to extrapolate decisions across different regions and cultures. Poor location decisions lead to financial losses and site closures. We set out to find a data-driven solution, enabling better resource allocation and reducing risks associated with site selection.

## Key Steps
